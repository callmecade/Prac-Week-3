<h2>Low and Slow</h2>
<p>This week I am extremely excited about a new cooking technique called <dfn>sous vide</dfn>.<br>
 In sous vide cooking, you submerge the food <small>(usually vacuum-sealed in plastic)</small> into a water bath that is precisely set to the target temperature you want the food to be cooked to.<br> 
 In his book,<cite>Cooking for Geeks</cite>, Jeff Potter describes it as <q>ultra-low-temperature poaching.</q> <br> </p>
<p>Next month, we will be serving <i>Sous Vide Salmon with Dill Hollandaise</i>. To reserve a seat at the chef table, <em>contact us before November 30</em>.</p>
